# Creating Jira tickets from campaigns
This campaign is an example of how to create tickets alongside changes in campaigns.
It will:

- Find repositories with `fmt.Sprintf`
- Open changesets to replace them with `strconv.Itoa`
- For each open changeset, create a Jira ticket mentioning the files that have been modified

It demonstrates how to use [steps.outputs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/campaigns/references/campaign_spec_yaml_reference#steps-outputs) and [campaigns spec templating](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/campaigns/references/campaign_spec_templating).

## How to use
- Modify the `jira_project`, `jira_username`, `jira_sitename` flags with your own
- Create a [JIRA API token](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/) and set it as the `JIRA_TOKEN` environment variable.


## Limitations
Campaigns has a declarative syntax for code changes: if the state of the codebase has not changed between two runs, there will be no additional changesets created.
It's up to the user to make sure that the steps the campaign runs are declarative.
In this simple example, tickets are not "declarative": every time that the campaign runs, and changesets are created or updated, a new ticket will be created (instead of tickets being updated).
